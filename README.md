# download-audio-with-yt-dlp-best-quality-
Just a basic script to run yt-dlp. It downloads an audio file per url given. It can also take in the param `-a file.txt` and process each url (new url per line). It also creates a file to remember which item has been successfully downloaded so it won't download duplicate files.
